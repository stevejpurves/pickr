<h3>About our terms of service</h3>
<p>Welcome to <span class='pt'>pick this</span>, a tool for social image interpretation.</p>

<p>We have tried to write these terms to be readable by people like us. Unfortunately, the realities of the legal world make this very difficult. Should you have any questions or concerns or would simply like to better understand how we do things, please do not hesitate to contact us. You should read each section to understand all the detailed terms of the agreement.</p>

<span class='pt'>pick this</span> was built by Ben Bougher, Jacob Foshee, Evan Bianco, and a combination of Matt Hall and Chris Chalcraft at the <a href="http://subsurfwiki.org/wiki/Geophysics_Hackathon_2014">2014 Geophysics Hackathon</a> in Denver, Colorado. Matt, Evan, and Ben work for Agile Geoscience Ltd, and the company accepts responsiblity for the maintenance and functionality web app, with certain limitations as outlined in this document.</p>
